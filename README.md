The FIRE organisation manages a number of luxury resorts. Each resort consists  of a group of small islands with a range of leisure facilities. Each island is connected by a ferry to one of more of the other islands of the resort. When guests arrive, they get a Pass (like a credit/debit card) which they can use for making payments at the resort.
