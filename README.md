# JAVA-Project-FIRE-
The FIRE organisation manages a number of luxury resorts. Each resort consists  of a group of small islands with a range of leisure facilities. Each island is connected by a ferry to one of more of the other islands of the resort. When guests arrive, they get a Pass (like a credit/debit card) which they can use for making payments at the resort. A Pass records a number of credits. We are concerned with using Passes to pay for ferry journeys. FIRE want to track people  at their resorts and they have decided to use the Passes to do this. This project will be implemented at the Fortunate Islands Resort.
